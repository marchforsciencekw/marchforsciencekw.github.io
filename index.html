  <h1>About</h1>
  <p><strong>ON APRIL 22, 2017, WE WALK OUT OF THE LAB AND INTO THE STREETS.</strong></p>

<p>We are scientists and science enthusiasts. We come from all races, all religions, all gender identities, all sexual orientations, all abilities, all socioeconomic backgrounds, all political perspectives, and all nationalities. Our diversity is our greatest strength: a wealth of opinions, perspectives, and ideas is critical for the scientific process. What unites us is a love of science, and an insatiable curiosity. We all recognize that science is everywhere and affects everyone.</p>

<p>As a satellite march, we will be organizing in Waterloo Park and marching to Victoria Park in Kitchener. We will be choosing a wheelchair accessible path in the coming weeks as details of the event are solidified. We invite educators in the region and members of the local government to reach out to us and speak at the event.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/">March for Science</a> is an international movement, led by organizers distributed around the globe. This movement is taking place because of the simultaneous realization by thousands of people who value science in their lives that staying silent is no longer an option. There are marches being planned across the United States and internationally.</p>

<p>If you wish to assist with this event <a href="mailto: marchforsciencekw@gmail.com">message us</a> and we will get you started.</p>

<p><strong>SCIENCE, NOT SILENCE</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/">March for Science</a> is a celebration of our passion for science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community. Recent policy changes have caused heightened worry among scientists, and the incredible and immediate outpouring of support has made clear that these concerns are also shared by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. The mischaracterization of science as a partisan issue, which has given policymakers permission to reject overwhelming evidence, is a critical and urgent matter. It is time for people who support scientific research and evidence-based policies to take a public stand and be counted.</p>
