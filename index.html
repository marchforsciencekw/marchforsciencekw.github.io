  <h1>About</h1>
  <p><strong>ON APRIL 22, 2017, WE WALK OUT OF THE LAB AND INTO THE STREETS.</strong></p>

<p>We are scientists and science enthusiasts. We come from all races, all religions, all gender identities, all sexual orientations, all abilities, all socioeconomic backgrounds, all political perspectives, and all nationalities. Our diversity is our greatest strength: a wealth of opinions, perspectives, and ideas is critical for the scientific process. What unites us is a love of science, and an insatiable curiosity. We all recognize that science is everywhere and affects everyone.</p>

<p><strong>As a satellite march, we will be organizing in Waterloo Town Square</strong>. We will be choosing a wheelchair accessible path in the coming weeks as details of the event are solidified. We invite educators in the region and members of the local government to reach out to us and speak at the event.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/">March for Science</a> is an international movement, led by organizers distributed around the globe. This movement is taking place because of the simultaneous realization by thousands of people who value science in their lives that staying silent is no longer an option. There are marches being planned across the United States and internationally.</p>

<p>If you wish to assist with this event <a href="mailto: marchforsciencekw@gmail.com">message us</a> and we will get you started.</p>

<p><strong>SCIENCE, NOT SILENCE</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/">March for Science</a> is a celebration of our passion for science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community. Recent policy changes have caused heightened worry among scientists, and the incredible and immediate outpouring of support has made clear that these concerns are also shared by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. The mischaracterization of science as a partisan issue, which has given policymakers permission to reject overwhelming evidence, is a critical and urgent matter. It is time for people who support scientific research and evidence-based policies to take a public stand and be counted.</p>

<p>We are contacting you on behalf of the March for Science for the Kitchener-Waterloo region, happening April 22nd at 12:30 PM at Waterloo Town Square. The March for Science a mouvement to build a broad, nonpartisan, and diverse coalition of organizations and individuals who stand up for science. We are advocating for evidence-based policymaking, science education, research funding, and inclusive and accessible science. </p>

<p>We are currently looking for scientists to give a 5-15 minutes talk about:</p>

<ol>
<li>What science means to them, and how their science impacts the world, </li>
<li>Why political engagement to promote science is important.</li>
<li>Their own history with political engagement (this could be a relatable story - we want people to feel like they can have an impact, and understand how they can to do so), or any other particular topic they would like to address. </li>
</ol>

<p>If you are interested, please send a message to marchforsciencekw@gmail.com, with the subject “Interested Speaker”. </p>

<p>Best, 
March for Science Kitchener-Waterloo.</p>

<h2 id="april-9-2017">April 9, 2017</h2>

<p>We will be relocating from Waterloo Park to <strong>Waterloo Town Square</strong>.</p>

<p>Relocating allows us to change the <a href="https://www.generosity.com/volunteer-fundraising/march-for-science-kitchener-waterloo">fundraising goal</a> from 500$ to 200$! Additionally, a generous donor has given us 100$ off the online platform, making the goal 100$.</p>

<p>We are so close to reaching that goal. Please consider <a href="https://www.generosity.com/volunteer-fundraising/march-for-science-kitchener-waterloo">donating here</a>.</p>

<p>We will donate all unspent money to Evidence for Democracy, a non-profit organization promoting the transparent use of evidence in government decision-making in Canada.</p>

<p><strong>More logistics detail about the change of location:</strong>
After many correspondences with the city of Waterloo, we determined that the park was a suboptimal location for the March for Science rally: construction scheduled to happen that day prevents the ways out of the park from being accessible to all, the liability insurance to reserve to park + the reservation fee was too high (300$ in total, plus more for insuring the area around the march), and uncollaborative staff in charge of the process.</p>

<p>The Town Square provides many advantages for the rally: it has higher pedestrian traffic, it is free to reserve for non-profit causes, the price for PA equipment rental is very good at 50$ per day for non-profits, and the liability insurance is only 108$, bringing the total price to 158$ to hold our march. Moreover, the staff in charge of this process has been extremely helpful and flexible on our behalf.</p>

<p>We plan to spend the remaining 42$ on banners and other functional items for the event, with the intent of upgrading our equipment (ex: getting loudspeakers) as donations allow.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>HL</p>

<h2 id="april-2-2017">April 2, 2017</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve launched our <a href="https://www.generosity.com/volunteer-fundraising/march-for-science-kitchener-waterloo">donation campaign</a>!</p>

<p>To be honest, none of us had done this before. I can say personally that I&rsquo;ve always been skeptical of these campaigns, and who they benefit.</p>

<p>How much money organizing a protest, which is a civil right, actually costs (if we are to get all the permissions from the city) has been very surprising.</p>

<p>As a result, we decided to be completely transparent about our budgets for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>To earn (not assume) trust when it comes to how we will choose to spend donor&rsquo;s money,</p></li>

<li><p>To familiarize people, especially members of the scientific community, with the process of organizing political protests. We scientists are great at understanding systems when we have information at our disposal. I hope this understanding will make a difference in the frequency at which we engage with politics. This was certainly one of my goals when organizing this protest.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>HL</p>

<p>Welcome to the official site for the March for Science satellite march in the Kitchener-Waterloo region! This site was built with the mindset of giving access to the event to anyone, regardless of what social media platform they choose to use.</p>

<p>There are no analytics on this marchforscience-kw.ca, because we deeply respect people&rsquo;s right to privacy on political matters. This was a decision made when the site was first built.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>HL</p>
